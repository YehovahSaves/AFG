## Introduction
In my experience, evangelizing to all of those who do not believe in The Messiah can be frustrating. Hindus can be some of the easiest folks to share The Gospel with, since they will usually engage in a conversation for a while, but, as will most lost souls, helping to lead them to a saving relationship with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; can often take a lifetime and might never happen. Humanists and evolutionists are often far more close minded, and many will not engage in a dialog, often will not be receptive to new (especially Christian) ideas and typically will try to push their illogical world view without ever attempting to question it, themselves. Muslims will often engage in dialog but, like humanists, typically do not want to hear what a Christian has to say but desire to espouse their beliefs. Israelis (outside of Israel) will often tolerate conversations that are tangentially spiritual, and they will sometimes listen to what a Christian has to say, apparently out of respect for Christians, but if one proselytizes too much, that will usually either greatly distance the Christian from the Israeli or spell the end of the relationship, altogether. Again, these are all gross generalizations and individuals can and will often surprise you.

Historically, some (even famous) Christians who have tried to proselytize to Israelis seem to have become so frustrated by the endeavor and the apparent lack of a &ldquo;desired&rdquo; outcome that they become antisemitic in their thinking. For me, I have come to realize that (perhaps often) God&rsquo;s role for me is merely to sow The Seed (i.e., share The Gospel Message), and the outcome is between the lost soul and &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. Thus, while sometimes frustrating, often one will never know (in this life) whether or not The Seed that he or she has sown will produce eternal fruit, [our directive is to go and make disciples of Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=DLNT).

Of course, making disciples goes far beyond merely sharing The Good News, but that is typically the first step and often, due to the rejection of The Truth, will never advance beyond that step. However, ultimately, there should be one or more people who you have shared The Truth with who have received it and who you are to baptize and teach to keep [The Commandments](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37-40&version=DLNT). (Obviously, this appears to be something that most people who call themselves Christians are failing to do, but if [Yehoshuah](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3091&t=KJV) Ha&rsquo;[Mashiach](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H4899&t=KJV) is truly your Lord, you will want to get started, ASAP, including attempting to keep [His Commandments](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37-40&version=DLNT), yourself.)

With that in mind, I would like to share a particular dialog that I have had with a lost soul who I have known for years who discovered that he has Israeli roots and decided to convert to Judaism as a result. (To give you a sense of the personality: Most Israelis are not Jewish enough for this individual.) For the sake of anonymity, I will refer to him as [Abedah](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/9.htm), and one of the takeaways from this dialog for you to consider is the eschatological view of this individual. His view is probably representative of the most conservative Israelis alive, today, and clearly spells future spiritual disaster for a significant portion of Israel.

## A Particular Experience
### Me
Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of [Yehoshua](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3091&t=KJV) the son of Josedech, the high priest; and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The [BRANCH](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H6780&t=KJV)... (Zechariah 6:11-12, KJV)

### Abedah
Just out of interest, why did you send that scripture?

### Me
For some reason, I just felt to send it to you. When I discovered it, years ago, I amazed that 483 years before Ha&rsquo;Mashiach was cut off, His Name was prophesied during the troublesome rebuilding of the temple that He would later teach at.

I tried sharing it with other folks, but, thus far, no one has been as impressed with the accuracy of this, now fulfilled, prophecy as I would have thought that they should be.

Anyway, I was praying and reflecting around the start of Shabbat, yesterday, and, for some reason, I felt like I needed to share that prophesy with you. Perhaps you will appreciate it more than others who I have shared it with? God knows.

### Abedah
While I fully understand what you&rsquo;re saying, &ldquo;the moshiach&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t been yet, and as you are completely aware I don&rsquo;t accept the NT as an authoritative document. Not only that jc/yoiske didn&rsquo;t fulfill &ldquo;any&rdquo; of the messianic prophecies needed to be fulfilled in the Torah.

And the issues with the xtians/messianic believers in jc continuously quote G-d&rsquo;s word (the Hebrew Scriptures, not the xtian ones) out of context.

### Me
Actually, that is from the Tanakh, and if Yehoshua did not fulfill the prophecies of Ha&rsquo;Mashiach&rsquo;s first coming, then there will be no Israeli Messiah, and the Tenakh is false, since the time given by Yehovah for His first coming as Ha&rsquo;Mashiach was when Yehoshuah road into Jerusalem on the 10th of Abib, just prior to His prophesied sacrifice for Israel and the world. (For example, see the Book of Daniel&rsquo;s 70 week prophecy for Israel, which has come and gone and could only have been fulfilled by Yehoshuah.)

BTW, I highly recommend the article about the [Antichrist](http://answersfromgod.com/2015/08/15/Pondering-the-Antichrist/) on the [AnswersFromGod.com](http://answersfromgod.com/) website to you, since I have a strong suspicion that much of Israel might accept the Antichrist as their messiah (at least for a time), which also seems to be prophesied, as that article documents.

Of course, the final remnant of Israel that survives to the time of Yehoshuah&rsquo;s return will be saved per the likes of Zechariah, but, prior to that, Israel will suffer and be refined through the time of Yaakov&rsquo;s trouble (also prophesied by the likes of Zechariah)...

### Abedah
Your approach to scripture is the problem, (you have an agenda to whom you &ldquo;think&rdquo; is being spoken about). And you&rsquo;re (as with other messianic believers) other problem is the sources you use.

In simplistic form, what is spoken about by [Jeremiah 16:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+16%3A19&version=KJV) &rdquo;will&ldquo; happen and then [Zechariah 8:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+8%3A23&version=KJV) will happen (as is happening now) no mention of us Jews coming to the Gentiles to learn, rather the other way around. Shalom my friend.

### Me
No, I just read the Word of Yehovah and accept it as it is written. It is pretty clear and does not require much (i.e., any) human explanation. Your problem appears to be with Yehovah and His Word, not with me (His messenger). I will let you and Him work that out, since I already know who the winner of that battle will be.

The promise (of the new covenant) is that no Israeli will need to be taught by anyone but that Yehovah will write His Law upon their hearts. However, as has always been the case, Yehovah has made provisions for anyone who loves Him to be a part of His Kingdom and the promises thereof (e.g.  [Isaiah 56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+56&version=KJV)).

It sounds like you have a lot of pride, and I can tell you, from experience, Yehovah does not like that and will deal with it if you do not work to get rid of it on your own. Again, that is for you and Him to deal with...

Shalom.

### Abedah
In addition look at what G-d Himself says in Isaiah 45:7, by the way my friend, this has nothing to do with pride, and at the end of the day it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you or I think or feel scripture says, rather it matters what G-d&rsquo;s word says in &ldquo;context&rdquo;, etc., etc. I&rsquo;m only too happy to get together with you and go over it.

### Me
Yes, in the end, understanding The Truth of God&rsquo;s Word and being reconciled to Him is all that matters, for each of us.

### Abedah
So, do you want to at some point get together or not?

### Me
Honestly, I am not sure what the point of that would be. You believe that you have all of the answers and are not teachable, and I know that your &ldquo;understanding,&rdquo; if correct, would invalidate the Word of Yehovah. Thus, by definition, your understanding is wrong.

So, what good could possibly come from such a meeting/discussion but bitterness and strife?

One thing that I can tell you is that if you do not have Yehoshuah, you do not really have anything of lasting value. If your dad is ill and has beliefs that are similar to your own, it behooves you to get down on your knees and pray for understanding of The Truth for yourself and your father, before it is too late for him (and for you).

Shalom.

### Abedah
That is your opinion, (not factually, contextual) and I fully understand where you&rsquo;re coming from, btw, remember it was you that initiated this discussion knowing that I don&rsquo;t believe as you, but in saying that, I&rdquo;m only too happy to go over things with you in a &ldquo;contextual&rdquo; discussion. Shalom.

And in addition you make comment of my father and myself and our relationship with Hashem without you knowing anything about us is disrespectful and prideful to say the least my friend. I have shown nothing but respect, so I feel you are out of line, maybe you need to have a different approach. Shalom

### Me
Dude,

When you see someone killing himself (either temporally or eternally), it is probably better to try to save him, rather than ignoring the problem and putting a stamp of approval on his death certificate. Thus, even if it seems troublesome, most folks would probably agree that it is better to try to save the life...

### Abedah
Firstly, I&rsquo;m not your &ldquo;dude&rdquo;, secondly, your assuming that I need saving from something, again not &rdquo;factual&rdquo; from G-d&rsquo;s word (The Hebrew Scriptures). So I&rsquo;ll say this 1 last time for you, (so you understand) I&rsquo;m happy to get together and have a contextual, mature discussion about it, however if you don&rsquo;t want to, then that&rsquo;s fine, no need to reply . Shalom

### Me
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. (1 John 2:22-23, KJV)

And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. (2 Timothy 3:15-17, KJV)

`A prophet out of thy midst, out of thy brethren, like to me, doth Jehovah thy God raise up to thee--unto him ye hearken... a prophet I raise up to them, out of the midst of their brethren, like to thee; and I have given my words in his mouth, and he hath spoken unto them all that which I command him; and it hath been--the man who doth not hearken unto My words which he doth speak in My name, I require it of him. (Deuteronomy 18:15-19, YLT)

Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against  ????, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: ???? hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&rsquo;s vessel. Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve ???? with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. (Psalm 2:1-12, KJV)

### Abedah
Christian missionaries, like yourselves and many others down throughout history, have tried to missionize us Jews into following and believing your ideals and your idolatry of &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; that G-d became a man and dwelt amongst us.

You also believe in some kind of triune godhead, and that your jesus paid the price for your sins, and everyone elses with his &ldquo;human&rdquo; blood, however according to the Hebrew Scriptures this is not the case and not factual.

Your Jesus/yoiske  didn&rsquo;t accomplish any of the messianic prophecies spoken about in the Hebrew Scriptures. &ldquo;The Messiah&rdquo; must be a member of the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:10) and a direct descendant of King David and King Solomon as is said in 2 Samuel 7:12-14; 1 Chronicles 22:9-10. Genealogy in the Bible is only passed down from father to son (Numbers 1:1-18).

(There is no evidence that jesus really had this pedigree, and the Christian Bible actually claims that he did &ldquo;not&rdquo; a &ldquo;birth father&rdquo; from the tribe of Judah descending from King David and King Solomon (Matthew 1:18-20).

Also when the Messiah is reigning as king of Israel, The Jews will be ingathered from their exile and will return to Israel, their homeland (Deut. 30:3; Isaiah 11:11-12; Jeremiah 30:3, 32:37; Ezekiel 11:17, 36:24). This has clearly &ldquo;not&rdquo; yet happened and we still await its fulfilment.

Also the temple in Jerusalem will be rebuilt (Isaiah 2:2-3, 56:6-7, 60:7, 66:20; Ezekiel 37:26-27; Malachi 3:4; Zechariah 14:20-21). The temple was still standing in Jesus&rsquo; day. It was destroyed 38 years after Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion and it has not yet been rebuilt.

#### Worldwide reign of peace.
There will be universal disarmament and worldwide peace with a complete end to war ( Micah 4:1-4; Hoseah 2:20; Isaiah 2:1-4, 60:18).
Wars have increased dramatically in the world since the start of Christianity.

#### Observance of the Torah embraced by ALL Jews.
The Messiah will reign as King at a time when all the Jewish people will observe G-d&rsquo;s commandments (Ezekiel 37:24; Deuteronomy 30:8,10; Jeremiah 31:32; Ezekiel 11:19-20,36:26-27). Jesus never ruled as King nor have all Jews embraced the commandments of G-d&rsquo;s Torah.

#### &ldquo;Universal knowledge of G-d&rdquo;
The Messiah will rule at a time when all the people of the world will come to acknowledge and serve the one true G-d (Zechariah 3:9, 8:23,14:9,16; Isaiah 45:23; Psalm 86:9; Zephaniah 3:9). This, as well, has not yet taken place and we await it&rsquo;s fulfilment.

All the criteria for the Messiah I found in numerous places in the Jewish Bible.
One very foundational good example of this is found in the book of Ezekiel 37:24-28.

Anyone can claim to be the Messiah or a group of people can claim that someone is the Messiah. However, if that person fails to fulfil all the criteria found in the Jewish Bible, he cannot be the Messiah.

According to the Christian Scriptures, Jesus seems to have understood this. As he was being crucified by the Romans, he cried out &ldquo;My G-d, my G-d, why have You forsaken me?&rdquo; (Mathew 27:46).

And then the Christian/messianic response (in order to deal with Jesus&rsquo; failure to fulfil the biblical messianic prophecies) from missionaries is to argue that he will accomplish them when he returns in the future.

It&rsquo;s important to understand that this second coming doctrine is an admission that Jesus didn't fulfil the messianic criteria. This rationalisation for his failure certainly provides no reason to accept him as the Messiah today.

Furthermore, The Jewish Bible does not have a messianic instalment plan where Messiah comes, fails in his mission, and then returns thousands of years later to finally succeed.

Missionaries will claim that because Jesus performed miracles, he must be the Messiah. However, we have no real evidence that Jesus actually performed any miracles. More significantly, they would not prove that he was the Messiah.

The Jewish Bible never says that we will be able to recognise the Messiah through the miracles that he will do. The Torah actually teaches that even false prophets can have the ability to perform supernatural Meracles (Deuteronomy 13:2-6).

So that said, at the end of the day, we Jews prefer to wait for the real thing according to G-d&rsquo;s promises and guidelines. The Jewish Bible provides a clear and consistent description of what the world will look like when the Messiah comes and this has clearly not yet transpired. So, we still await the coming of the true Messiah.

### Me
Isaiah 9:6, SLT: For a child was born to us, a son was given to us, and the dominion shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, everlasting Father, Captain of Peace.

Psalm 22:1, KJV: To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

Daniel 11:31, KJV: And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.

Daniel 12:11, KJV: And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.

===

One thing that you are correct about is that the temple will be rebuilt, but its terminal purpose will be for abomination (i.e., to worship a the man of sin).

The temple that Ezekiel prophesied will not be rebuilt until Yehoshua returns, since it is clear from the description that only He (i.e.,  ????) can accomplish the earth modifications that its foundation will require.

===

Isaiah 12:2, KJV: Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for ??? ???? is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.

Psalm 118:14, KJV: ??? is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

Zechariah 9:9, KJV: Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.

Zechariah 11:12-13, KJV: And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And ???? said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of ????.

===
I believe that this is the man who you are longing to serve:

And ???? said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. (Zechariah 11:15-17, KJV)

It starts as self-deception, but without repentance, ???? will give you over to full-blown, all out deception, which, if and when He does, would merely be to satisfy your own, wicked desires.

Choose this day whom you will serve: ???? or man. As for me and my house, we will only serve ????.

===

Zechariah 12:9-14, KJV: And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

===

There will be no true peace for Israel before Yehoshua returns. Just before He does return, all of the remaining remnant of Israel will be saved, but it will only be a third of those who have been regathered:

And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith ????, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, ???? is my God. (Zechariah 13:8-9, KJV)

===

Proverbs 30:4, KJV: Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is His Name, and what is His Son's name, if thou canst tell?

===

He gave you His Name and His Son's Name, and His Name is Salvation, but you must call upon Him in order to receive it:

And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of ???? shall be saved: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as ???? hath said, and for the residue whom ???? shall call. (Joel 2:32, Darby)

===

He and His Son are One and the same. As the Name, Yehoshua, suggests, ???? made Himself a human body to in dwell. It was His, perfect blood that was shed for the sins of the world. There is no other Way, no other Name and no other Salvation.
