I initially felt to write on this subject after communicating with a rising star in the Christian "intellectual" movement who I feel clearly has extreme flaws in his worldview, in spite of informing him about the disagreement between a number of his teachings and the Bible. Chris White has done an excellent job of exposing the non-Biblical teachings of a number of popular conveyors of various false doctrines, and I am very grateful to him for his research and expositions of his research. However, after much reflection, I am not certain whether or not that is the appropriate course of action for me to take.

Paul rejoiced when Christ was preached both in pretense and in truth ([Philippians 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+1%3A18&version=KJV)). Thus, even preachers of the Good News who share the Gospel due to wrong motivations can help to build God's Kingdom, even though they, themselves might not enter into it (e.g., [Matthew 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A21-23&version=KJV)).

According to Master Yehoshuah, a false prophet's motives are to (probably eternally) destroy those who believe in Him (e.g., [Matthew 7:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A15&version=DLNT)). They can be discerned by the way that they live their lives (e.g., [Matthew 7:16-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A16-20&version=DLNT)); they do not do the teachings of Yehoshuah (e.g., [Matthew 7:24-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A24-27&version=DLNT)).
