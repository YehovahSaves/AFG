Thanks for providing what you feel is support for your belief. However, <u><a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20131026/PC16/131029431">psychiatry (as a whole) has also authorized the release of numerous schizophrenics from treatment when it was politically expeditious for them to do so</a></u> (some of whom you can detect if you merely take the time to show a bit of compassion to homeless folks who cross your path). Furthermore, <u><a href="http://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSM-II.pdf">the APA used to acknowledge sexual confusion as a mental disorder in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) before it caved in due to political pressures</a></u>. Yet, it does not take a genius nor an accreditation to realize that someone who is born a man but desires to be a woman is not thinking correctly.

Add to that basic realization a bit of knowledge about genetics, and one can clearly discern that one's desire's about his or her sexual identity are irrelevant: One's sex is determined at the moment of his or her conception. Thus, while you claim that your intent is to show compassion, aiding one in his or her delusion is really helping him or her to destroy himself or herself. The compassionate (although politically incorrect) thing to do is to say something like, "Johnny, I understand that you want to be a woman, but you are a man..."

I have known many people who have suffered from what can reasonably be classified as sexual addiction. This compulsion manifests itself in many forms and, like most addictions, <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBtgA0ZLWo0">"advances" (changes) over time</a></u>. Often the victim of such an addiction desires freedom, but the changes that this addiction causes to the brain, one's neurophysiology, etc. equate to <u><a href="http://www.quitpornography.org/worse-than-drug-addiction.html">an addictive power beyond that of heroin</a></u>. Nonetheless, freedom is possible, but it will not come via placation.

Here are some examples of individuals who have been released from this addiction, who now enjoy real freedom and true life:

You might notice that what keeps people in this sort of bondage is often their own refusal to acknowledge the error of their ways. Of course, they are not aided by those who feign that their faults do not exist. If you really want to help these people, you must help them to acknowledge the truth, not hide the truth from them.
