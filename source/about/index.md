Everyday, throughout the day, we are each confronted with countless decisions. Which choices are correct, and which choices are incorrect? Is it possible to know? Which choices will lead to better outcomes for ourselves and those whom we love? Is there a way to choose wisely?

The &ldquo;[Answers From God](http://amzn.to/1KiS8lM)&rdquo; series describes some of the insights that the author has obtained from God, and it details how to have a relationship with God and how to obtain one&rsquo;s own answers from God to all of one&rsquo;s &ldquo;life&rdquo; questions, big or small.

As the chapter entitled, &ldquo;Postulates About Origins,&rdquo; demonstrates, there is a God&mdash;a Creator who loves and cares for each and every one of us&mdash;and He did not leave us to fend for ourselves, so to speak. He gave us a &ldquo;manual for life.&rdquo; If one will choose to understand God&rsquo;s plan for his or her life and to live his or her life as God intended, he or she will begin to experience real life (in all of its fullness), both in this life and in the life to come.

Some of the content in this book series started off as summaries from surfing adventures that the author emailed to friends and acquaintances. As it matured, it became answers from God to some of the most common and some of the most pressing issues that one might face as he or she traverses the pathways of his or her relatively short life. These answers came from the manual for life that God gave to humankind.
