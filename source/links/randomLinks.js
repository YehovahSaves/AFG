(It seems to start as part of the process in which individuals within a society turn from the Law of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; in order to do their own will, which inevitably includes sexual sin, and child murder is adopted&#8212;at least in part&#8212;to hide the fruit that such sin produces. Of course, since people who are in such a state have no interest in the One, True God, they end up becoming entangled in demon worship of one form or another, and then&#8212;at a point&#8212;children start being offered to those demons as a blood sacrifice.) This connection seems to be intact in a number of countries, today. Indeed, it appears that wiccans and other satanists like to work in abortion clinics, since they believe that abortion is a &#8220;sacred rite&#8221; of their respective religions (again, as have demon worshipers throughout history). This is a sin that needs to stop and be repented for.</div>',links:['<a href="http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/alabama-supreme-court-recognizes-unborn-as-children?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NCRegisterDailyBlog+National+Catholic+Register&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader#When:2013-01-16%2011:17:01">Alabama Supreme Court Recognizes Unborn as &#8220;Children&#8221;</a>','<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Demonic-Abortion-Rev-Thomas-Euteneuer/dp/1559220627">Demonic Abortion: A Sobering Commentary on the Satanic Nature of the Modern Abortion Industry (Matthew Balan)</a>','<a href="http://www.sba-list.org/negligence">Kermit Gosnell is Not an Outlier</a>','<a href="http://www.ignitumtoday.com/2012/10/23/who-im-voting-for/">Who I&#8217;m Voting For (Brent Stubbs)</a>','<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mjbates3/DefendingtheHelpless.doc?attredirects=0">Defending the Helpless (Mark Bates)</a>','<a href="http://aclj.org/planned-parenthood/planned-parenthood-prayer-thanks-abortion-providers-sacred-care">Planned Parenthood&#8217;s Prayer of &#8220;Thanks for Abortion Providers&#8221; and their &#8220;Sacred Care&#8221;</a>','<a href="http://www.brnow.org/News/November-2009/Abortion-clinic-director-sees-ultrasound,-quits">Abortion clinic director quits after she sees ultrasound output</a>: Now you understand why Planned Parenthood has ceased providing ultrasound output to the mothers of their victims.']},{name:"Creation",intro:"",links:['<a href="http://www.puritandownloads.com/evolution-demolished-by-astonishing-dna-complexity-evidence-for-biblical-creation-creationism-by-alex-williams-dr-jonathan-sarfati-dr-jason-lisle-dr-a-e-wilder-smith-dr-john-macarthur-mike-riddle-others-free-videos-mp3s-etc/">Astonishing DNA Complexity</a>','<a href="https://youtu.be/CUkyIM3M6qk">What do Fossils have to do with the Gospel?</a>','<a href="http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/4073072252.html">Quantum Physics and the Bible Agree</a>','<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnLVWEqcNKc">Intelligent Design (Dr. Frank Turek)</a>','<a href="http://www.puritandownloads.com/creations-marvelous-molecular-machines-creation-magazine-live-free-videos-mp3s-etc/">Molecular Machines</a>','<a href="http://evolutiondemolition.info/">Evolution Demolition</a>','<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rCkFLq3uts">How DNA Destroys Evolution (Mike Riddle)</a>']},{name:"Extra Biblical Evidence",intro:"",links:['<a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/jesus/nonchristianaccounts.html">Non-Christian References to the Trial of Jesus</a>','<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/genetics/dna-structure/dna-what-does-it-prove/">DNA&mdash;What Does It Prove?
