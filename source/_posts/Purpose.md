This post is dedicated to answering questions of the sort, "What is my purpose?"

## What Is My Purpose?
> For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him.
> <cite>[Colossians 1:16, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A16&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> And that He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them, and rose again.
> <cite>[2 Corinthians 5:15, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A15&version=KJV)</cite>

Thus, your purpose is to live for God. To do that:

> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
> <cite>[Matthew 7:12, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A12&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
> <cite>[Romans 13:8, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A8&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> ...Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
> <cite>[Matthew 22:37-40, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37-40&version=KJV)</cite>

Therefore, to live for God, you must (continually) love others as you love yourself. When you do that, you will have fulfilled God&rsquo;s purpose for your life.

## What Is God&rsquo;s Plan for Me?
> The Lord... is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
> <cite>[2 Peter 3:9, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2 Peter 3:9&version=KJV)</cite>

Thus, the plan of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) for you (and everyone) is to obtain eternal life (i.e., not to eternally perish):

> And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
> <cite>[John 17:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A3&version=KJV)</cite>

To obtain God&rsquo;s direction:

> Trust in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
> <cite>[Proverbs 3:5-6, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> Delight thyself also in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV): and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV); trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
> <cite>[Psalms 37:4-5, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+37%3A4-5&version=KJV)</cite>

## What Does [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) Require of You?
> He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) require of thee, but to **do justly**, and to **love mercy**, and to **walk humbly with thy God**?
> <cite>[Micah 6:8, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+6%3A8&version=KJV)</cite>
