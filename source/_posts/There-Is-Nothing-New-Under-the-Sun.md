### Appreciation
This article was inspired, in no small part, by many revelations about the Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) given to [Bill Cloud](http://billcloud.org/about-bill/). Of course, I do not believe that everyone of Mr. Cloud's beliefs and teachings are Biblically correct. Thus, as always (and [as I recommend in the chapter entitled, "Understanding God's Word"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T74IHGO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00T74IHGO&linkCode=as2&tag=answ0aa-20&linkId=UISMRPOF6AWJXLWQ)), it behooves the student to validate everything that is taught against the revealed Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV).

### Preamble
Moreover, as I attempted to put together a brief but compelling summary of some of the more impressive parallels between Biblical history and our day and age, I realized that the Bible is far too pregnant with knowledge to enable any such undertaking. Thus, I scaled back the goal of this article to merely provide some surface level insights into how the original deception continues to repeat itself, today, and I highly encourage you to dive into the Bible, in all of its facets--including with an eye on understanding the historic patterns that it mentions and how they have embodied themselves throughout human history and into our present day and age.

As any student of history understands, the history of mankind is replete with repeating cycles (or patterns) that are reemerging in (or resonating into) our present reality. Thus, one who is aware of history understands that the present is rooted in the past. For example, the Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) puts it like this:

>Whatever has happened--that's what will happen again; whatever has occurred--that's what will occur again. **There's nothing new under the sun.** People may say about something: "Look at this! It's new!" But it was already around for ages before us. There's no remembrance of things in the past, nor of things to come in the future. Neither will there be any remembrance among those who come along in the future.
><cite>[Ecclesiastes 1:9-11, CEB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%201:9-11&version=CEB)</cite>

According to the ultimate source of history, it is clear that one who knows the past can grasp the present. Thus, perhaps we should take a little trip down memory lane in order to realize what, exactly is going on in our present day and age.

### The Deception in its Original Form
In the beginning, [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) created man in His image ([Genesis 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Genesis%201:27)). He put the man in His garden to [serve](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H5647&t=KJV) and [protect](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8104&t=KJV) it ([Genesis 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Genesis%202:15)). However, [the man failed to protect the garden from the teachings (deception) of the serpent but, rather, was persuaded by them (i.e., desired to be like &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;) and corrupted himself](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A1-7&version=DARBY) and [the entire creation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:17-19&version=DARBY) by eating [the forbidden fruit](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:16-17&version=DARBY).

Furthermore, in the beginning, the serpent did not focus his teachings directly upon the man but directly targeted [his helper](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Genesis%202:18), [who was the weaker of the two](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Peter%203:7), [while (apparently) the man watched and listened](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Genesis%203:6). Also, this [hostility](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H342&t=KJV) against the woman by the serpent was promised to continue ([Genesis 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Genesis%203:15)).

### The Deception in its Modern Form
Now, fast forward, a bit, to the recent history of the a nation that was originally founded upon faith and trust in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV)--one that based its laws upon the Law of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV). For example:

>The Americans combine the notions of Christianity and of liberty so intimately in their minds, that it is impossible to make them conceive the one without the other; and with them this conviction does not spring from that barren traditionary faith which seems to vegetate in the soul rather than to live.
><cite>Democracy in America, Volume I, Chapter XVII (1835)</cite>

While some much needed change in the area of so called racial tolerance seemed to play out in the 1960s--a tolerance that would have been manifest from the country's inception had its founders completely adhered to the Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) (e.g., [Exodus 21:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Exodus%2021:16), [Acts 17:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Acts%2017:26), etc.)--depravity and humanism continued to creep into society at an accelerated pace. Along with a stated (but arguably imperfectly practiced unto this day) recognition of the basic, God given equality of all human beings crept in the advocacy for immorality--particularly [adultery](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Exodus%2020:14) and [covetousness](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Exodus%2020:17). Men and women, once again, set aside [God's Law](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Galatians%205:14) in favor of their lusts--effectively establishing themselves as gods in their own eyes.

To a large extent, the impetus for this shift away from desiring to obey [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) towards wanting to be like Him was yet another attack on women under the guise of freeing women from oppression (aka [feminism](http://www.conservapedia.com/Feminism)), while men looked on. Sounds familiar, does it not?

Utilizing history as a guide, we can be relatively certain of a fate not unlike [that of the first human society](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6-7&version=DARBY) or [Rome](https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2010/12/27/feminism-responsible-for-the-fall-of-rome/), etc., if we do not [repent of our wickedness and return to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/2%20Chronicles%207:14).
