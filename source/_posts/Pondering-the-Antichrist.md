Imagine a ruler who arises and destroys the enemies of Israel (including virtually eliminating the threat of Islam to the world) and who rebuilds the temple and restores the daily sacrifice. Would you serve him? Would you accept him as the Messiah of Israel? 

The Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) has a lot to say about the coming, most wicked, vile leader who will rule on the earth for more than 3.5 years prior to the return of [Yehoshua](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3091&t=KJV) to establish His Eternal Kingdom. The Antichrist is so animalistic that the Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) refers to him as "the beast" (e.g., [Revelation 17:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17%3A17&version=KJV)).

## The Kingdom of the Antichrist
My [article about Iran](http://answersfromgod.com/2015/05/23/Iran/) provides some insights concerning the sequence of nations (kingdoms) that lead to the nation out of which the Antichrist will arise. However, the kingdom of the Antichrist is horrible, inhumane and ruled by ten kings before (and at least seven continue on in some capacity after) his rise to power. This kingdom is so animalistic that the Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) also refers to it as "the beast" (e.g., [Revelation 17:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17%3A16&version=KJV)), thus making it somewhat indistinguishable from the Antichrist, himself.

>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
><cite>[Daniel 7:7, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7%3A7&version=KJV)</cite>

A careful study of the Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) seems to reveal that the kingdom of the Antichrist is **not** worldwide in scope. For example, as my [article entitled, &ldquo;Iran,&rdquo;](http://answersfromgod.com/2015/05/23/Iran/) illustrates, a nation in the region of modern Iran expands its territory westward, northward and southward, unabated ([Daniel 8:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8%3A4&version=KJV)), until a nation in the region of modern Greece and Turkey destroys the first nation ([Daniel 8:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8%3A7&version=KJV)). The later nation splinters into four other nations ([Daniel 8:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8%3A8&version=KJV)) that still exist when [Yehoshua](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3091&t=KJV) returns to establish His Kingdom (e.g., [Daniel 7:11-12, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7%3A11-12&version=KJV)), and the Antichrist arises out of **one** of those four, splinter nations, which he expands southward, eastward and toward Israel ([Daniel 8:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8%3A9&version=KJV)). Also, while [Daniel 11:41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A41&version=KJV) indicates that he overthrows many countries, it also indicates that the area of modern Jordan (i.e., Edom, Moab and at least part of Ammon) escape out of his hand. He does, however, gain control of Egypt ([Daniel 11:42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A42&version=KJV)), Libya and Ethiopia ([Daniel 11:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A43&version=KJV)).

>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. As concerning **the rest of the beasts**, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
><cite>[Daniel 7:11-12, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7%3A11-12&version=KJV)</cite>

That said, it seems that the nation of the Antichrist does gain control over the other three "splinter" nations ([Revelation 13:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A2&version=KJV)), and he is given power over all nations ([Revelation 13:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A7&version=KJV)).  Yet, opposition to him appears to come from Chittim ([Daniel 11:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A30&version=KJV)) and, possibly, from the east (perhaps China) and north (perhaps Russia)&mdash;[Daniel 11:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A44&version=KJV). Thus, how his web of influence is spun remains to be seen.

In spite of the indicated directions of the Antichrist&rsquo;s expansion of his nation&rsquo;s borders ([Daniel 8:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8%3A9&version=KJV))&mdash;which *could* seem to eliminate a nation that is north or west of Israel as a candidate&mdash;the Antichrist&rsquo;s nation is clearly north of Israel ([Daniel 11:40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A40&version=KJV)). So, the nation of the Antichrist is expected to originate somewhere north of Israel and to expand southward at least into Egypt and Ethiopia and eastward from there. Therefore, in spite of current appearances, this might indicate that he does not gain direct control over the likes of Europe and that the ultimate, direct extend of his Kingdom will be from somewhere north of Israel and include much of the Middle East and Northern Africa.

Perhaps his conquests and expansion could be akin to those of Hitler but originating somewhere about Turkey and expanding southward and eastward from there.

## The Empowerment of the Antichrist
(Probably prior to his rise to power) the ten kings of kingdom that he rules (or will rule) will destroy Babylon ([Revelation 17:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17%3A16-18&version=KJV)). Those ten kings give their nation (kingdom) to the Antichrist ([Revelation 17:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17%3A17&version=KJV)). Probably during the Antichrist&rsquo;s reign ([Revelation 17:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17%3A12-13&version=KJV)), he dispenses with three of those kings ([Daniel 7:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7%3A8&version=KJV)).

>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
><cite>[Daniel 7:8, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7%3A8&version=KJV)</cite>

However, it appears that the last 3.5 years of his reign shall be empowered by Satan, himself, after Satan is cast out of Heaven to earth by Michael, and this period shall be such a time of trouble and fierce persecution of the people of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) that the end of it is delimited by the scattering of their power (e.g., [Daniel 12:1,7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+12%3A1%2C7&version=KJV), [Revelation 12:6-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12%3A6-17&version=KJV), [Matthew 24:21-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A21-22&version=KJV)).

## Some Characteristics of the Antichrist
He magnifies himself above all, including all gods, and will have no regard for the concerns of women ([Daniel 11:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A37&version=KJV)). Yet, he will honor a god that is different from any of his ancestral gods ([Daniel 11:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A38&version=KJV)). At some point, his arm and his right eye shall be struck (possibly in battle), after which his arm and right eye will be useless ([Zechariah 11:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+11%3A17&version=KJV)).

His ancestors were the ones who destroyed Jerusalem and the temple ([Daniel 9:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+9%3A26&version=KJV)). He might also be Assyrian (e.g., [Micah 5:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+5%3A5-6&version=KJV)). However, with [Yehoshua](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3091&t=KJV), it was known where He was to be born (e.g., [Micah 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+5%3A2&version=KJV)), but this knowledge actually caused some to erroneously deny Him as being Ha&rsquo;Maschiach (e.g., [John 7:41-52](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+7%3A41-52&version=KJV)). Thus, it stands to reason that if one puts too much emphasis upon the Antichrist&rsquo;s ancestry, he or she may be deceived about the identity of the Antichrist.

For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd **in the land**, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.

Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

Furthermore, read what [Chabad.org has to say about their expectations of Mashiach](http://www.chabad.org/library/moshiach/article_cdo/aid/101747/jewish/Appendix-II.htm) in relation to what the Bible (including the Tanakh) has to say about the Antichrist. Also, note [this interesting bit of Jewish tradition discussed in the book entitled, &ldquo;The Doctrine of The Messiah in Medieval Jewish Literature,&rdquo; by Joseph Sarachek](https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=bqfXAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=extirpated), which can be contrasted with the likes of [Daniel 11:45-12:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+11%3A45-12%3A1&version=YLT) and [Matthew 24:15-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A15-22&version=YLT).
