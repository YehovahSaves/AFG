As most of the world, I have been caught up with thoughts of self-preservation, self-enrichment, self-indulgence, etc. Thus, seeing the evils of Islam (both historic and, especially, contemporary) evokes ingrained feelings of hatred and internal calls for justice and revenge. This is all natural and a part of the nature of the fallen man that I am. However, my Master ([Yehoshua](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3091&t=KJV) Ha'[Mashiach](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H4899&t=KJV)) has set a supernatural example for me to follow and has given me a supernatural calling for me to heed.

Unlike the Muslim, who is taught by his prophet and his god to hate, we are called to love our enemies and to pray for those who persecute us (e.g., [Matthew 5:43-48](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A43-48&version=YLT) and [Luke 6:27-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:27-36&version=YLT)). We are told that [this life is but a vapor](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4%3A14&version=NKJV) and that [our hope transcends this life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14&version=DLNT), and we are instructed to share the life giving message of hope with those who are perishing and to build up and encourage one another (e.g., [1 Thessalonians 5:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A11&version=DLNT) and [Hebrews 3:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+3%3A13&version=DLNT)).

Thus, while I, personally (currently), do not have any problem with defending myself, my family and friends and my nation from the physical attacks of those Muslims who choose to act upon the inhumane teachings and examples of their prophet and their book in order to create sorrow and chaos and to murder, kill and destroy, I (currently) believe that it may also be acceptable to choose not to resist such wicked men (e.g., [Ecclesiastes 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3&version=YLT), [Matthew 5:43-48](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A43-48&version=YLT) and [Luke 6:27-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:27-36&version=YLT)). History also reveals that Europe would have been lost, long ago, to invading Muslim hordes if brave, faithful, vastly outnumbered Christian men did not defend themselves (aided by the One, True God&mdash;[&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV)) against the murderous Muslim rampage of their day.

However, I have heard enough testimonies of former Muslims, who have heard and received the Good News and bravely chose to reject the lies of Islam for the Truth of Christ, to know that hope for the salvation of the Muslim is not lost while he still has breath in his lungs. Furthermore, I know that God ([&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV)) is still in control of His creation, and He lived as a perfect man, suffered and died for and still loves all of those who are made in His Image, even those Muslims who are most rebellious against Him.

Also, those Muslims who do not receive the Truth are going to suffer in hell for eternity, once their soul leaves their body. Thus, if we love [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), we should love those who He loves, and [He does not desire that any should perish but that all should be saved](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A9&version=DLNT). If we love them, we must share the [life giving seed with them](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+4%3A14&version=DLNT). [Most probably, only some of them will receive it.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+4%3A15-20&version=DLNT) However, the choice is theirs; let us be faithful to our calling and try to snatch as many of them from bonds of satan as we can.

Thus, I believe that this (i.e., obeying the Commandments of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV)) is the key to the Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Humanist, Evolutionist, etc. problem. Perhaps, part of the reason that [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) is allowing the invasion of our land by pagan cultures, like Islam, is to lead some of them to salvation. Perhaps, what is required for those souls to be saved is for us to be obedient to [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV)...

### This, Temporal Life Is Not what &ldquo;It&rdquo; is all about
>And having summoned the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, &ldquo;If anyone wants to be following after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and be following Me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it. But whoever will lose his life for the sake of Me and the good-news will save it. For what does it profit a person to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? For what might a person give in-exchange-for his life? For whoever is ashamed-of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels&rdquo;.

>Do not be loving the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone is loving the world, the love of the Father is not in him. Because everything in the world&mdash;the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the boastful-pride of life&mdash;is not from the Father, but is from the world. And the world is passing-away, and its desire. But the one doing the will of God abides forever.

### Salvation Comes Through Faith in The Word of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; that You Proclaim
>But what does it say? &ldquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&rdquo;, that is, the word of faith which we are proclaiming, that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and you believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is believed with the heart resulting-in righteoueusness, and it is confessed with the mouth resulting in salvation.
>
>For the Scripture says [in [Isaiah 28:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+28%3A16&version=YLT)] &ldquo;everyone putting-faith upon Him will not be put-to-shame&rdquo;. For there is no distinction between both Jew and Greek&mdash;for the same Lord is Lord of all, being rich toward all the ones calling-upon Him. For &ldquo;everyone who calls-upon the name of the Lord will be saved&rdquo; [[Joel 2:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel+2%3A32&version=YLT)].
>
>How then may they call-upon the One in Whom they did not believe? And how may they believe the One Whom they did not hear? **And how may they hear without one proclaiming?** And how may they proclaim if they are not sent-forth?&mdash;just as it has been written [in [Isaiah 52:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+52%3A7&version=YLT)]: &ldquo;How beautiful are the feet of the ones announcing-good-news-of good things!&rdquo;
><cite>[Romans 10:8-15, DLNT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A8-15&version=DLNT)</cite>

### You, Go and Proclaim The Good News
>And having come to them, Jesus spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;All authority in heaven and on earth was given to Me. Therefore having gone, make-disciples-of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to keep all that I commanded you. And behold&mdash;I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the age&rdquo;.

### What Are The Commandments?
>And the One said to him: &ldquo;&lsquo;You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind&lsquo; [[Deuteronomy 6:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+6%3A5&version=YLT)]&mdash;this is the great and foremost commandment. And the second is like it, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&lsquo; [[Leviticus 19:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+19%3A18&version=YLT)]. The whole Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments&rdquo;.

<img src="/images/Love_Your_Neighbor_04.jpg" height="70%" width="70%" style="width:70%;height:70%" />

### What Is Love?
>Love is patient. Love shows-kindness. Love does not envy, does not brag, is not puffed-up, does not behave-dishonorably, does not seek its own things, is not provoked, does not count the bad, does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices-with the truth, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

## Other Scriptures to Ponder
>But what doth it say? &ldquo;Nigh thee is the saying&mdash;in thy mouth, and in thy heart:&rdquo; that is, the saying of the faith, that we preach; that if thou mayest confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and mayest believe in thy heart that God did raise him out of the dead, thou shalt be saved, for with the heart doth [one] believe to righteousness, and with the mouth is confession made to salvation; for the Writing saith, &ldquo;Every one who is believing on him shall not be ashamed,&rdquo; for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all [is] rich to all those calling upon Him, for every one&mdash;whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.
>
>How then shall they call upon [him] in whom they did not believe? **and how shall they believe [on him] of whom they did not hear? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching?** and how shall they preach, if they may not be sent? according as it hath been written, &ldquo;How beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good tidings of peace, of those proclaiming good tidings of the good things!&rdquo;

>And He was saying to everyone, &ldquo;If anyone wants to be coming after Me, let him deny himself, and let him take up his cross daily, and let him be following Me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it. But whoever loses his life for My sake&mdash;this one will save it. For what is a person profited&mdash;having gained the whole world, but having lost or having forfeited himself For whoever is ashamed-of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed-of this one when He comes in the glory of Himself and the Father and the holy angels...&rdquo;
