>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

>When the wicked flourish like grass and all the workers of evil blossom, it is so they can be destroyed forever.

>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget Elohim. For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.

>The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.

>Be glad about this, even though it may now be necessary for you to be sad for a while because of the many kinds of trials you suffer. Their purpose is to prove that your faith is genuine. Even gold, which can be destroyed, is tested by fire; and so your faith, which is much more precious than gold, must also be tested, so that it may endure. Then you will receive praise and glory and honor on the Day when Jesus Christ is revealed.

>Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept His ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) of hosts? And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. Then they that feared [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) spake often one to another: and [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), and that thought upon His Name. And they shall be mine, saith [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not.

>For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear My Name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) of hosts. **Remember ye the law of Moses** my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, **with the statutes and judgments**.

>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

>A Psalm of David. Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. **Trust in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), and do good**; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV); and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV); trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass. And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. Rest in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), and wait patiently for Him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for He seeth that his day is coming. The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.

>A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) upholdeth the righteous. [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.

>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called: and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
>
>He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?
>
>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
>
>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field; but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away. But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also. And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whence then has it darnel? And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this. And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]? But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it. Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary.
>
>Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field. But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man, and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one]; and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels. As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age. The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness; and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.
