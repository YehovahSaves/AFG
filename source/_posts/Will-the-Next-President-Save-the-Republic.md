### Will any of the presidential candidates save the USA if elected?
The answer that one gives (**not** the truth) depends, in part, upon his or her worldview. Someone looking at the world scene, with all of its wars and conflict, is likely to conclude that humans can solve our problems by getting rid of our differences. Thus, the humanist (and, surprisingly, the Islamist) might (apparently logically) conclude that the solution to the major problems that we are facing is a global, worldwide (or "one-world") government and a single ("tolerant" but uniform) religion for all of humanity.

In order to implement this "solution," true individuality cannot be tolerated (but can be substituted for meaningless individuality&mdash;like self-expression via purchase decisions, including fashion choices and the like). Thus, the humanist (and the Islamist) "solution" requires uniformity and conformity at all costs. Beyond trivial differences, individuality must be crushed in order to achieve the goal of world "peace" and "prosperity".

On the other hand, if you are a "biblically literate" Christian, you will realize that [God created the nations as a way of mitigating human evil](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11%3A1-9&version=VOICE). Every human being is [naturally selfish](http://biblehub.com/james/1-14.htm); selfishness is rebellion against God's Law (which is [summarized as loving others as one loves one's self](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Galatians%205%3A14)). Thus, as human beings uniformly conform to man-made (self-centered) laws and traditions that fly in the face of God's Law, we tend maximize selfishness (and, thus, evil).

For example, God has endowed each of us with unique qualities, including unique perspectives, unique ways of thinking, etc. and [has a unique purpose for each of us](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12&version=DLNT). However, in order to achieve the humanist agenda, much of our individuality must be subverted. To acquiesce (and deploy) humanism "globally," individuality must be crushed. Thus, in order to achieve the (selfish) goal of humanist uniformity, countless atrocities must be committed against countless individuals. Thus, the "peace" of the humanist (and Islamist) "solution" is a charade that comes at the expense of individual liberty and happiness, and the humanist (and Islamist) ideal is really maximally selfish (and, thus, evil) of all who desire it.

### Will Donald Trump save the USA?
Regarding Trump, much of what he says sounds excellent to the hearts of those who are fed up with tyrannical presidents (current and past). However, Dr. Alan Keyes believes that Trump will be like Obama in that he will sidestep the constitution in order to please conservatives (as Obama did in order to please leftists). [Keyes also suspects that Trump might be an "in the closet" leftist](http://www.prayinjesusname.org/2016/01/alan-keyes-is-donald-trump-a-democrat-is-ted-cruz-a-citizen).

After I saw [Dr. Keyes' interview](http://www.prayinjesusname.org/2016/01/alan-keyes-is-donald-trump-a-democrat-is-ted-cruz-a-citizen), I prayed about it and went to sleep, and I awoke to a dream which indicated that [Hitler utilized the same rhetoric as Trump](http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/elect.htm). That is, Hitler's platform was that he would make Germany great, again, and Trump's platform is that he will make America great, again.

Needless to say, I have been leery of Trump since then. However, I am uncertain about any of the candidates. [Roger Stone and others have made fairly compelling cases against Cruz](http://stonezone.com/article.php?id=706), yet he is the son of a pastor and [has taken an admirable, faithful (although increasingly unpopular) stand for Israel](https://youtu.be/x2ZVihACwQ0). Unlike Obama, [Rubio has refused to take the title of "savior."](https://youtu.be/xNeE1pSOomg) I suspect that Huckabee might be a godly man who might lead us in the correct direction, but he seems to have little support. ([Remember that men chose Barabbas over Yehoshuah--aka Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27%3A15-25&version=DARBY).) Of course, if Sanders or Clinton wins, then we can expect the trajectory of the nation's decline to continue or even increase.

However, it seems not to matter who gets in (utilizing contemporary history as a guide): Once they get in, they merely advance the globalists' agenda of destroying the nation. So, I wonder if Trump will do the same? God knows.

It is starting to look like Trump is similar to Hitler (and Obama) in that he is offering lots of vague and, now, possibly contradictory promises to different groups. For example, [Trump has praised Planned Parenthood](http://www.lifenews.com/2016/02/23/msnbc-donald-trump-is-more-electable-after-saying-planned-parenthood-does-a-good-job/) for things that are really tangential to their core business of murdering children and destroying families. Yet, he says that he will defund them. Yet, he clearly indicates that he is not going to stop abortion (in the code of something like "we are not going to let them go back to doing it in back allies").

Furthermore, in general, Trump seems to say whatever is beneficial to himself at the moment; thus, ultimately, leaving little difference between him and Obama. For example: [Is Trump a Leftist?](http://www.rawstory.com/2011/04/donald-trump-secret-liberal-the-top-10-reasons-conservatives-should-hate-him/) and [Trump is a Terrible Republican](http://eaglerising.com/1149/donald-trump-is-a-terrible-republican/).

Also, the following article would seem to indicate that he is more of a "typical" (i.e., not really understanding salvation nor having a real relationship with God) Catholic than a twice born follower of The Messiah, but it also indicates a Biblically sound approach to repentance and restitution (e.g., [Ezekiel  18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+18&version=DARBY)): [Trump, "I Don't Believe I've Ever Asked God for Forgiveness."](http://freedomoutpost.com/2015/07/trump-i-dont-believe-ive-ever-asked-god-for-forgiveness/)

Thus, again, Trump might be another Obama in that no one (not even Trump) knows what he is going to do once he gets elected, but he is going to do whatever he wants to do, and anyone who gets in his way will probably get trampled on. I would not be surprised if Trump is just a big "setup," like Obama was. After going through this (once) with Obama, it looks like the citizens of the USA might be about to make the same mistake with Trump, and only God knows what the outcome will be.

The truth is, as was the case with Obama, we do not really know what kind of a president Trump will be. On the other hand, with Clinton or Sanders, we know that she or he will continue the globalists' agenda. Furthermore, [the extremely left leaning Huffington Post wrote that both GOP and Democrat sponsors apparently held a secret meeting to discuss derailing Trump's campaign](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aei-world-forum-donald-trump_us_56ddbd38e4b0ffe6f8ea125d). Hummm...

Nevertheless, the next president will have been put there by God ([&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV)) in order to achieve His purposes (e.g., [Daniel 2:21, 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+2%3A21%2C+4%3A17&version=DARBY); [Romans 13:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A1&version=DARBY); [Proverbs 8:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+8%3A15&version=DARBY); [Psalms 75:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+75%3A6-7&version=DARBY); etc.). For example, I do believe that a significant purpose for the appointment of Obama as president by [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) may have been to continue to bring judgement upon the USA for abandoning Him and for forsaking His Law (e.g., [Galatians 5:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Galatians%205%3A14), [Matthew 22:36-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-40&version=DLNT), etc.).

God ([&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV)) help us:

>If I shut up the heavens that there be no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; and my people, who are called by my name, humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin, and heal their land.

### 2016-03-05 Update
Again, I have lots of research to do on the various candidates, but I was extremely impressed by the speeches that Donald Trump gave at Liberty University, as well as the relationship that he has forged with it. The introduction to his January 18, 2016 speech was quite amazing, and seems to paint a picture of a kind, generous man ([the kind of man who &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; loves](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+10&version=DLNT)):

As one of my wise friends explained, [God can utilize anyone to do His Will](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+44%3A24-%3B+Isaiah+45%3A3%2C+13&version=DARBY). He recalled that folks were also comparing Ronald Reagan to Hitler before he was elected, and Reagan was clearly one of the greatest presidents of our lifetime.

Today, I am not feeling so great about contemplating Trump as the next president of the USA:
