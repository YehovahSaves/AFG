According to the likes of [Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV), the little horn (aka the Antichrist) comes out of one of the spin offs of [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV). That is, the two horned ram (the region of ancient Media-Persia, which is now modern Iran) will take over much of the Middle East. After that, the goat with a prominent horn (the region of ancient [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV), which now approximately includes modern Greece and the southern and western coasts of Turkey) destroys that expanding, Media-Persian nation. After that, [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV) splits into four nations. Out of one of those nations comes the little horn.

I suspect that, if the [Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) &ldquo;process&rdquo; is starting to unfold, one reason that [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) appointed Obama as President of the USA was to advance that process. Furthermore, in that case, [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) may have previously directed the diminishing support of the Shah by the US Government, culminating in his total abandonment by President Carter in 1979. The US Government then&mdash;apparently mindlessly and unintentionally&mdash;strengthened the current Islamic Regime by attacking its two most significant enemies (i.e., Saddam Hussein in 1991 and the al-Qaeda in 2001).

I believe that the hand of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) can clearly be seen in all of this, since the United Kingdom and the USA originally ousted democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mosaddegh and installed Shah Zahedi in 1953 and helped maintain Zahedi's rule utilizing evil, murderous tactics, all for the sake of oil (i.e., the Iranian oil interests of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP)&mdash;covetousness. Utilizing what appears to be divine justice, [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) appears to have utilized this same motivation (i.e., covetousness for Middle Eastern Oil) to cause the U.S., British, etc. militaries to further strengthen the current Iranian Regime via eliminating Hussein and weakening al-Qaeda.

If the [Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) process is currently unfolding, we would expect to see Iran destroy any Iranian opposition in the region (save for Israel)&mdash;including ISIS, if ISIS is not really an Iranian front. (Of course, if&mdash;like Hamas and Hezbollah&mdash;ISIS is really just an Iranian front organization, then we would expect Iran to support and sustain it.) Ultimately, [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV) (most probably Turkey or a Turkish coalition) would then destroy Iran.

[Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) might *not* be unfolding, now. If it is, then I suspect that the prophecy about the destruction of Elam (currently, SW Iran)&mdash;e.g., [Jeremiah 49:34-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+49%3A34-39&version=KJV)&mdash;will probably be fulfilled by [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV) ([Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV)). Otherwise, if the destruction of Elam comes first, then [Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) might be way out in the future.

Time will most certainly reveal the order and the details. However, given Iran's progress in Lebanon and Syria and now (possibly) Iraq, [the predicted rise of Media-Persia](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) prior to its defeat by [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV) may be unfolding right before our eyes.

FYI, Obama&rsquo;s objective may be to weaken Israel and Iran via a direct confrontation between the two so that Sunni nations can later take over both, but Obama&rsquo;s objectives are unimportant; the plan of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) is the only one that will prevail. Also, perhaps Iran&rsquo;s takeover of Syria can explain the damage done to Israel in its coming war with Syria ([Isaiah 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+17&version=KJV)).

Another interesting, possible motivation for arming Iran was asserted by [David Bay](http://www.prophecyinthenews.com/bringing-saudi-arabia-down-with-david-bay/). In particular, he assets that various "nonconforming" dictatorships, including Saudi Arabia, must be done away with in order to usher in [the coming one-world currency system](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13:16-18&version=KJV). Thus, Mr. Bay asserts that the impetus for arming Iran is to enable it to destroy the current Saudi regime, allowing the current Saudi regime to be replaced with one that will conform to [the coming beast system](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13:16-18&version=KJV).
