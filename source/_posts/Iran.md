According to the likes of [Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV), the little horn (aka the Antichrist) comes out of one of the spin offs of [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV). That is, the two horned ram (the region of ancient Media-Persia, which is now modern Iran) will take over much of the Middle East. After that, the goat with a prominent horn (the region of ancient [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV), which now approximately includes modern Greece and the southern and western coasts of Turkey) destroys that expanding Media-Persian nation. After that, [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV) splits into four nations. Out of one of those nations comes the little horn.

I suspect that, if the [Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) &ldquo;process&rdquo; is starting to unfold, one reason that &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; appointed Obama as President of the USA was to advance that process. If that process were to unfold, now, we would expect to see Iran destroy any Iranian opposition in the region (save for Israel)&mdash;including ISIS, if ISIS is not really an Iranian front. (Of course, if&mdash;like Hamas and Hezbollah&mdash;ISIS is really just an Iranian front organization, then we would expect Iran to support and sustain it.) Ultimately, [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV) (most probably Turkey or a Turkish coalition) would then destroy Iran.

[Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) might *not* be unfolding, now. If it is, then I suspect that the prophecy about the destruction of Elam (currently, SW Iran)&mdash;e.g., [Jeremiah 49:34-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+49%3A34-39&version=KJV)&mdash;will probably be fulfilled by [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV) ([Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV)). Otherwise, if the destruction of Elam comes first, then [Daniel 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) might be way out in the future.

Time will most certainly reveal the order and the details. However, given Iran's progress in Lebanon and Syria and now (possibly) Iraq, [the predicted rise of Media-Persia](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8&version=KJV) prior to its defeat by [Yavan](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3120&t=KJV) may be unfolding right before our eyes.

FYI, Obama&rsquo;s objective may be to weaken Israel and Iran via a direct confrontation between the two so that Sunni nations can later take over both, but Obama&rsquo;s objectives are unimportant; the plan of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is the only one that will prevail. Also, perhaps Iran&rsquo;s takeover of Syria can explain the damage done to Israel in its coming war with Syria ([Isaiah 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+17&version=KJV)).
