If you have a question about what God&rsquo;s Word has to say about a particular subject, please send it to me via the [contact form](http://answersfromgod.com/EmailSubscribe/index.html). God willing, I will prayerfully try to answer it (either here or via a private e-mail message to you), when and if I am able to do so (when and if [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) reveals the answer to me).

Also, since this page is becoming rather long, I have started the process of migrating related questions to individual posts (linked off of the [main page](http://answersfromgod.com/)).

## What is the Evidence For God?
> For His invisible things&mdash;both His eternal power and divine-nature&mdash;are clearly-seen, being understood since the creation of the world in the things made, so that they are without-excuse.
> <cite>[Romans 1:20, DLNT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A20&version=DLNT)</cite>

As the Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) asserts: the clear, overwhelming, obvious, common sense evidence (that even a child could understand) for the loving, all powerful (i.e., omnipotent), transcendent, omniscient Creator is the amazing, precise, well designed (in all of its facets) creation.

A painting requires a painter. A building requires a builder. The creation requires The Creator. These are simple, powerful, irrefutable **facts**.

## Was the Messiah&rsquo;s Name Foretold?
>Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of **[Yehoshua](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3091&t=KJV)** the son of [Yehozadak](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3087&t=KJV), the high priest; and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) of hosts, saying, Behold the man **whose name is The [BRANCH](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H6780&t=KJV)**; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV): even he shall build the temple of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV); and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
><cite>[Zechariah 6:11-13, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+6%3A11-13&version=KJV)</cite>

## How do I Love Others?
> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
>
> And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.
>
> Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
>
> And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.
> <cite>[Luke 3:9-14, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+3%3A9-14&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
> <cite>[James 2:14-17, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-17&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
>
> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
> <cite>[1 John 3:16-19, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A16-19&version=KJV)</cite>

That is, just start **DO**ing things **for others** that you would like them to do for you if your situations were reversed. For example, if you come across someone who is hungry and destitute, invite her to a restaurant for a meal and conversation with you.

## What is the Result of Overcoming the World?
>...To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
><cite>[Revelation 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2:7&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>...He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
><cite>[Revelation 2:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2:11&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>...To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.
><cite>[Revelation 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2:17&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>...And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
><cite>[Revelation 2:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2%3A26-27&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
><cite>[Revelation 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3:5&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.
><cite>[Revelation 3:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3:12&version=KJV)</cite>

## How Do I Overcome the World?
>...they have escaped the pollutions of the world through **the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ**...
><cite>[2 Peter 2:20, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A20&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that **believeth that Jesus is the Son of God**?
> <cite>[1 John 5:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A4-5&version=KJV)</cite>

Thus, focusing on the sin of those who are helpless to stand against it is not the solution to their ultimate problem (eternal death) nor to the moral decay that we see all around us, but the ultimate solution (salvation) to the ultimate problem is a knowledge of and belief (faith) in the Savior of humanity.

## Does the Bible Say that Men Cannot Become Rich via Evil Means?

>...among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
><cite>[Jeremiah 5:26-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+5%3A26-28&version=KJV)</cite>

The Bible and common observation confirm that people can and do grow rich via wicked means. However, the Bible also indicates that this state cannot exist without an ongoing loss of God's blessings and that the end of such means will not be good:

>Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.
><cite>[Jeremiah 5:24-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+5%3A24-25&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?
><cite>[Jeremiah 5:29-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+5%3A29-31&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
>
>Trust in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV): and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV); trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
>
>Rest in [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), they shall inherit the earth.
>
>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
>
>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
>
>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
>
>A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) upholdeth the righteous. [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
>
>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth. For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
>
>The steps of a good man are ordered by [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV): and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) upholdeth him with his hand.
>
>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
>
>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. For [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
>
>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. Wait on [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV), and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
>
>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
>
>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off. But the salvation of the righteous is of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV): he is their strength in the time of trouble. And [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

## When Does the New Heaven and Earth Arrive?
Chris White asserted that the current heaven and earth conclude at the end of the current age and that the new heaven and earth come to be at the onset of Christ&rsquo;s Millennial Reign. It appears that the Word of [&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3068&t=KJV) confirms this assertion:

> ...the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men... the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
>
> Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
> <cite>[2 Peter 3:7,10-13, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A7%2C10-13&version=KJV)</cite>
