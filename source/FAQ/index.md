If you have a question about what God&rsquo;s Word has to say about a particular subject, please send it to me via the [contact form](http://answersfromgod.com/EmailSubscribe/index.html). God willing, I will prayerfully try to answer it (either here or in a private e-mail message to you), when and if I am able to do so (when and if &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; reveals the answer to me).

## What is the Evidence For God?
> For His invisible things&mdash;both His eternal power and divine-nature&mdash;are clearly-seen, being understood since the creation of the world in the things made, so that they are without-excuse.
> <cite>[Romans 1:20, DLNT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A20&version=DLNT)</cite>

As the Word of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; asserts: the clear, overwhelming, obvious, common sense evidence (that even a child could understand) for the loving, all powerful (i.e., omnipotent), transcendent, omniscient Creator is the amazing, precise, well designed (in all of its facets) creation.

A painting requires a painter. A building requires a builder. The creation requires The Creator. These are simple, powerful, irrefutable **facts**.

## What Is My Purpose?
> For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him.
> <cite>[Colossians 1:16, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A16&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> And that He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them, and rose again.
> <cite>[2 Corinthians 5:15, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A15&version=KJV)</cite>

Thus, your purpose is to live for God. To do that:

> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
> <cite>[Matthew 7:12, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A12&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
> <cite>[Romans 13:8, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A8&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> ...Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
> <cite>[Matthew 22:37-40, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37-40&version=KJV)</cite>

Therefore, to live for God, you must (continually) love others as you love yourself. When you do that, you will have fulfilled God&rsquo;s purpose for your life.

## What Is God&rsquo;s Plan for Me?
> The Lord... is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
> <cite>[2 Peter 3:9, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2 Peter 3:9&version=KJV)</cite>

Thus, the plan of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; for you (and everyone) is to obtain eternal life (i.e., not to eternally perish):

> And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
> <cite>[John 17:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A3&version=KJV)</cite>

To obtain God&rsquo;s direction:

> Trust in &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
> <cite>[Proverbs 3:5-6, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> Delight thyself also in &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
> <cite>[Psalms 37:4-5, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+37%3A4-5&version=KJV)</cite>

## How do I Love Others?
> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
>
> And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.
>
> Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
>
> And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.
> <cite>[Luke 3:9-14, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+3%3A9-14&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
> <cite>[James 2:14-17, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-17&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
> Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
>
> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
> <cite>[1 John 3:16-19, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A16-19&version=KJV)</cite>

That is, just start **DO**ing things **for others** that you would like them to do for you if your situations were reversed. For example, if you come across someone who is hungry and destitute, invite her to a restaurant for a meal and conversation with you.

## What is the Result of Overcoming the World?
>...To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
><cite>[Revelation 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2:7&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>...He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
><cite>[Revelation 2:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2:11&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>...To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.
><cite>[Revelation 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2:17&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>...And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
><cite>[Revelation 2:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2%3A26-27&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
><cite>[Revelation 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3:5&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.
><cite>[Revelation 3:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3:12&version=KJV)</cite>

## How Do I Overcome the World?
>...they have escaped the pollutions of the world through **the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ**...
> <cite>[2 Peter 2:20, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A20&version=KJV)</cite>

<!-- -->
>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that **believeth that Jesus is the Son of God**?
> <cite>[1 John 5:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A4-5&version=KJV)</cite>

Thus, focusing on the sin of those who are helpless to stand against it is not the solution to their ultimate problem (eternal death) nor to the moral decay that we see all around us, but the ultimate solution (salvation) to the ultimate problem is a knowledge of and belief (faith) in the Savior of humanity.

## When Does the New Heaven and Earth Arrive?
Chris White asserted that the current heaven and earth conclude at the end of the current age and that the new heaven and earth come to be at the onset of Christ&rsquo;s Millennial Reign. It appears that the Word of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; confirms this assertion:

> ...the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men... the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
>
> Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
> <cite>[2 Peter 3:7,10-13, KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A7%2C10-13&version=KJV)</cite>

There are currently many active questions on a [Disqus Forum](https://disqus.com/home/discussion/channel-squid/ask_your_neighbor_if_you_could_ask_god_a_question_what_would_it_be/) that I started. God willing, I hope to transfer some of the best questions and answers from that forum to here, as time goes on.
